# Kneat
A Kotlin implementation of the NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) 
algorithm developed by Kenneth O. Stanley. This project is heavily based off of https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python
and wouldn't be here without them. 

# This library is currently under construction




## Terminology

## Library Usage

### Configuration

### Pipeline

### Genes

### Genomes

### Species

### Reproduction

### Stagnation / Culling

### Evaluation
TODO: Mention that evaluation may be done across different sessions due to the nature of the pipeline

### Reporting

### Networks

### Asynchronicity
TODO: Mention how the library is parallel by default
TODO: Neural Networks generated by this are executed asynchronously
